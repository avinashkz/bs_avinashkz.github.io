          <h2 id="toc_1"style="margin-top:0;">Education</h2>
          
          <p> I was born in the idyllic state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala">Kerala</a> in India.  I started my schooling in Kendriya Vidyalaya and moved across different states in the country with my parents, both managers in public sector companies.  Then we moved to Jersey, UK where  I finished my schooling from Le Rocquier School and Hautlieu School.  After school, I went back to India to my home state to do my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at <a href="http://fisat.ac.in.html">Federal Institute of Science and Technology</a> under Mahatma Gandhi University. Now I am doing my <a href="https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca">Masters in Data Science</a> at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver.  I hope to become a Data Scientist, and a good one at that.</p>

          <br>
          <h2 id="toc_2" style="margin-top:0;">Employment</h2>
          <p>During  my final year of Engineering I got campus placement with TCS and Standard Chartered GBS.  After graduation, I took up the offer of <a href="https://www.sc.com/technology/">Standard Chartered GBS</a>, Chennai as an Analyst. I worked as part of Identity and Access Management (IAM) & Global Information Security (GIS) teams, which integrate business-critical applications to Oracle Identity Governance and SailPoint IdentityIQ, to automate user restrictions and prevent data leakage. I worked there for a year till I called it quits in July 2017 to pursue my real passion in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
          
          <br>
          <h2 id="toc_3" style="margin-top:0;">Interests & Projects</h2>
          <p>I also have interests like Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.  During the final year of engineering I was introduced into the world of robotics and Arduino.  I have gone on to do projects like <a href="robot.html">Gesture Controlled Wall Climbing Robot</a>, Secret door pattern detector and built a custom quadcopter using Pixhawk. I try to widen my knowledge and skills by developing websites and doing various projects.  Where my learning and online browsing fall short, I enroll into online courses to help me with my projects such as <a href="car.html">Virtual Self Driving Car</a> and <a href="doom.html">Powering AI to Play Doom</a> and few others. You are welcome find details of these projects in the Blogs and Projects section of my Website. Additionally, I have also done many projects on Data Science and Machine Learning which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/avinashkz">GitHub page</a>.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 id="toc_4" style="margin-top:0;">Other Stuff/Interests</h2>
          <p>I am a huge movie buff and a hardcore Chelsea fan. My weekends are spent catching up on football reruns when I can.  I was part of the St. Clements F.C., Jersey in 2010. I also played as striker for the FISAT college football team while doing bachelors. Besides football, like every Indian, cricket is a big time fascination; I have played for my school team during grade 12 and 13.  I also enjoy playing tennis in late evenings.  In additions to listen to music, I love watching movies and I am a massive fan of Malayalam cinema and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohanlal">Mohanlal</a>.  I used to play guitar during my school days and hope to get started on it again after graduation.  I have tried my luck learning dancing and drums. However I cannot claim anything on that front.I am a foodie, and relish different cuisines. But my interest is only in the eating part. I can cook for survival though. </p>
